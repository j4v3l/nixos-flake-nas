### Drive Formatting

#### `nvme-manager.sh format <slot> <filesystem> [label]`

Formats a drive with the specified filesystem and optional label.

**Supported Filesystems:**

- `ext4` - Linux native (recommended for NAS)
- `xfs` - High-performance Linux filesystem
- `btrfs` - Advanced features (snapshots, compression)
- `ntfs` - Windows compatibility

```bash
# Format slot 2 as ext4 with label 'data'
sudo nvme-manager.sh format 2 ext4 data

# Format slot 3 as XFS with label 'backup'
sudo nvme-manager.sh format 3 xfs backup

# Format slot 4 as BTRFS (auto-label as 'drive4')
sudo nvme-manager.sh format 4 btrfs
```

**Safety Features:**

- Shows drive information before formatting
- Requires typing 'yes' to confirm
- Automatically unmounts before formatting
- Creates GPT partition table with single partition

### Drive Cloning

#### `nvme-manager.sh clone <source-slot> <destination-slot>`

Creates an exact bit-for-bit copy of one drive to another.

```bash
# Clone slot 2 to slot 3
sudo nvme-manager.sh clone 2 3

# Clone system drive (be very careful!)
sudo nvme-manager.sh clone 1 6
```

**Features:**

- Progress bar showing clone status
- Automatic unmounting of both drives
- Verification and safety checks
- Works with any filesystem or even unformatted drives

### Health Monitoring

#### `nvme-manager.sh health`

Comprehensive health report for all installed drives.

```bash
$ nvme-manager.sh health
=== NVMe Drive Health Report ===
Generated: Thu Nov 21 10:30:15 PST 2024

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Temperature: 78¬∞C (Warm)
  ‚úÖ Available Spare: 95%
  üìä Power On Time: 890 hours (37 days)
```

**Monitored Parameters:**

- Overall SMART health status
- Critical warnings (wear, temperature, reliability)
- Drive temperature with thresholds
- Available spare blocks
- Power-on hours and data written

### Mount Management

#### `nvme-manager.sh mount <target> [mount-point]`

Mount drives by slot number, label, or mount all at once.

```bash
# Mount all labeled drives to default locations
sudo nvme-manager.sh mount all

# Mount slot 2 to default location (/mnt/drive2)
sudo nvme-manager.sh mount 2

# Mount slot 3 to custom location
sudo nvme-manager.sh mount 3 /mnt/backup

# Mount by label to default location (/mnt/data)
sudo nvme-manager.sh mount data

# Mount by label to custom location
sudo nvme-manager.sh mount data /mnt/nas
```

#### `nvme-manager.sh unmount <target>`

Unmount drives by slot, label, mount point, or all at once.

```bash
# Unmount all NVMe drives
sudo nvme-manager.sh unmount all

# Unmount by slot
sudo nvme-manager.sh unmount 2

# Unmount by label
sudo nvme-manager.sh unmount data

# Unmount by mount point
sudo nvme-manager.sh unmount /mnt/backup
```

### RAID Management

#### `nvme-manager.sh raid <command> [options...]`

Create and manage software RAID arrays using multiple NVMe drives.

**Supported RAID Levels:**

- **RAID 0**: Striping (performance, no redundancy)
- **RAID 1**: Mirroring (redundancy, 50% capacity)
- **RAID 5**: Striping with parity (good balance, N-1 capacity)
- **RAID 6**: Double parity (high redundancy, N-2 capacity)
- **RAID 10**: Stripe of mirrors (performance + redundancy)

```bash
# Show current RAID status
nvme-manager.sh raid status

# Create RAID 5 with slots 2, 3, 4, 5
sudo nvme-manager.sh raid create 5 2 3 4 5

# Create RAID 1 mirror with slots 2 and 3
sudo nvme-manager.sh raid create 1 2 3

# Destroy RAID array
sudo nvme-manager.sh raid destroy /dev/md0
```

**RAID Creation Process:**

1. Validates all specified drives exist
2. Shows confirmation with drive details
3. Unmounts all drives automatically
4. Creates mdadm RAID array
5. Formats with ext4 and appropriate label
6. Provides mount instructions

### Partitioning

#### `nvme-manager.sh partition <slot> [type]`

Create partition tables on drives without formatting.

```bash
# Create GPT partition table (recommended)
sudo nvme-manager.sh partition 2 gpt

# Create MBR partition table (legacy compatibility)
sudo nvme-manager.sh partition 3 mbr
```

Use this when you want to manually create multiple partitions or need specific partition layouts.

### Secure Wiping

#### `nvme-manager.sh wipe <slot>`

Securely erase all data on a drive.

```bash
# Securely wipe slot 2
sudo nvme-manager.sh wipe 2
```

**Wiping Process:**

1. Attempts NVMe secure erase (instant, hardware-level)
2. Falls back to zero-fill if secure erase unavailable
3. Double confirmation required (very destructive!)
4. Automatic unmounting before wiping

### Performance Benchmarking

#### `nvme-manager.sh benchmark <command> [options...]`

Comprehensive performance testing and drive comparison tools.

**Available Commands:**

- `single <slot>` - Full benchmark of a single drive
- `quick <slot>` - Quick benchmark (faster, smaller test size)
- `compare <slot1> <slot2>` - Compare performance between two drives
- `all` - Quick benchmark of all installed drives

```bash
# Full benchmark of slot 2
sudo nvme-manager.sh benchmark single 2

# Quick benchmark of slot 3
nvme-manager.sh benchmark quick 3

# Compare performance between slots 2 and 3
nvme-manager.sh benchmark compare 2 3

# Quick benchmark all drives
nvme-manager.sh benchmark all
```

**Benchmark Features:**

- **Sequential Read Testing**: Measures large file read performance
- **Sequential Write Testing**: Measures large file write performance (non-system drives)
- **Random Read IOPS**: Measures small random read performance
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Tracks drive temperature during testing
- **Health Checks**: Verifies drive health after intensive testing

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Automated Health Monitoring

The system automatically monitors drive health and logs warnings:

```bash
# Check system logs for health alerts
sudo journalctl -t nvme-monitor

# View recent health monitoring
sudo systemctl status nvme-health-monitor

# Check monitoring timer status
sudo systemctl list-timers nvme-health-monitor
```

### Shell Aliases

When the NVMe Manager is enabled, convenient aliases are available:

```bash
nvme-ls           # Same as nvme-list
nvme-fmt          # Same as nvme-format  
nvme-health-check # Same as nvme-health
nvme-temp         # Show just temperature info
nvme-bench        # Same as nvme-benchmark
nvme-bench-all    # Same as nvme-benchmark all
list-drives       # Show lsblk output
mount-all         # Mount all labeled drives
```

### Integration with Existing Storage Module

The NVMe Manager works alongside the existing storage module:

- **Storage Module**: Handles automatic mounting and Samba sharing
- **NVMe Manager**: Provides manual management and advanced operations
- Both modules can be enabled simultaneously
- NVMe Manager commands work with storage module mount points

### Custom Configuration

```nix
nvmeManager = {
  enable = true;
  installUtils = true;
  enableMonitoring = true;
  monitoringInterval = "30m";  # Check every 30 minutes
  
  alertThresholds = {
    temperature = 70;          # Lower temperature threshold
    availableSpare = 15;       # Higher spare threshold
  };
};
```

## üö® Safety Guidelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

1. **Slot 1 is typically your system drive** - be extremely careful with operations on `/dev/nvme0n1`
2. **Always backup important data** before formatting, cloning, or RAID operations
3. **Confirm slot numbers carefully** - wrong slot selection can destroy data
4. **Test commands on empty drives first** if you're unsure

### üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Safety Features

- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations
- **Drive information display** before dangerous operations
- **Automatic unmounting** to prevent filesystem corruption
- **Slot validation** to prevent invalid operations
- **Clear labeling** of system vs. data drives

### üîß Troubleshooting

#### Drive Not Detected

```bash
# Check if drive is physically present
lspci | grep -i nvme
lsblk

# Check dmesg for hardware issues
sudo dmesg | grep -i nvme

# Verify drive health
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvmeXn1
```

#### Mount Issues

```bash
# Check filesystem for errors
sudo fsck /dev/nvmeXn1p1

# Check mount status
findmnt

# Manual mount
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/yourlabel /mnt/mountpoint
```

#### RAID Problems

```bash
# Check RAID status
cat /proc/mdstat
sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0

# Reassemble RAID array
sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 /dev/nvme3n1
```

## üìö Integration Examples
