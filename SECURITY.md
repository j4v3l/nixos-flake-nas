## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities if you discover:

- Authentication bypasses
- Unauthorized network access
- Information disclosure
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**üö´ DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to the maintainer privately
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)
3. **Wait**: Allow time for investigation and patching before public disclosure

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Security Fix**: Based on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## ‚ö° Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)

- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Full system compromise

### High (Fix within 1 week)

- Privilege escalation
- Significant information disclosure
- Network security bypass

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)

- Limited information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Configuration vulnerabilities

### Low (Fix in next release)

- Minor security improvements
- Hardening opportunities
- Documentation issues

## üîß Security Configuration

### Initial Setup Security Checklist

After deploying, complete these security steps:

- [ ] Change default password: `sudo passwd jager`
- [ ] Set Samba password: `sudo smbpasswd -a jager`
- [ ] Add SSH public keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- [ ] Disable SSH password authentication
- [ ] Verify firewall rules: `sudo iptables -L`
- [ ] Test fail2ban: `sudo fail2ban-client status`
- [ ] Mark passwords configured: `sudo touch /etc/nixos/.passwords-configured`

### Ongoing Security Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Keep system updated with `nix flake update && rebuild`
- **Monitor Logs**: Check system logs regularly with `journalctl`
- **Review Access**: Monitor SSH and Samba access logs
- **Backup Configurations**: Keep secure backups of configurations
- **Security Scanning**: Run periodic security scans

### Network Security Configuration

The configuration includes these network security measures:

```nix
# Example firewall rules (from modules/samba.nix)
networking.firewall = {
  extraCommands = ''
    # Restrict Samba to local networks only
    iptables -A nixos-fw -s 192.168.0.0/16 -p tcp --dport 445 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A nixos-fw -s 10.0.0.0/8 -p tcp --dport 445 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A nixos-fw -s 172.16.0.0/12 -p tcp --dport 445 -j ACCEPT
  '';
};
```
